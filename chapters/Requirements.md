# Requirements

First of all starknet is still in alpha, that's why codes can be changed often.

So, we need to have a node and npm is included with Node.js.<br>
If you need to download it, you can check the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current).

Version of node: **v21.1.0**
Version of npm: **10.2.3**

For changing the version of npm...
```bash
npm install -g npm@10.2.3
```

After installation of Node.js, let's open the terminal again and create a folder where you want...
```bash
# For example on desktop
mkdir How-to-use-Fibrous-SDK && cd How-to-use-Fibrous-SDK
```

Install the **fibrous-router-sdk** with using terminal...
```bash
npm install fibrous-router-sdk
```

Install the **starknet** library with using terminal...
```bash
npm install starknet
```
