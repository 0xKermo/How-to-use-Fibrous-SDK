# Requirements

First of all starknet is still in alpha, that's why codes can be changed often.

So, we need to have a node and npm is included with Node.js.
If you need to download it, you can check the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current).

Version of node: v21.1.0
Version of npm: 10.2.3

For changing the version of npm...
```bash
npm install -g npm@10.2.3
```

After installation of Node.js, let's open the terminal again and create a folder where you want...
```bash
# For example on desktop
mkdir amm && cd amm
```

Install the **fibrous-router-sdk** with using terminal...

```bash
npm install fibrous-router-sdk
```

Also we need to install **starknet**...
```bash
npm install starknet
```

For our scripts create a folder as src...
```bash
cd src
```
